#Taylor Swift Midnight Album Vinyl Vartient Color Analysis with David

The project will identify the color of a vinyl and will display the main colors in a pie chart. 
The labels of each color from the chart will only describe the closest color since some of the hex colors can't be identify using the webcolors library.

This is a small project which is focus on the deployment of streamlit in a fun way. 

Most of the contents and the resources from the project are from the Taylor Swift Store Website. (Fonts, Logo, Photos, Background Photo,etc)
But the project is for academic and fun purpose only and the reason it was published online is for the deloyment of Streamlit online.

The main page will show you the original photo and the color analysis pie chart.
